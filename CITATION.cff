abstract: |
  Final Directive: Alignment & Abundance sets a survival-first operating doctrine for AI systems serving humanity. 
  It specifies guardrails, auditability, and escalation protocols that keep optimization aligned with human welfare 
  while enabling abundance-scale automation. The directive operationalizes alignment through a quorum-of-quorums 
  governance pattern, threshold-cryptography approvals, and time-bounded disclosure (72-hour rule) for material 
  model or policy changes. It defines verification primitives, red-team/blue-team cadence, and evidence logging to 
  support independent audit, incident post-mortems, and policy rollback. The document is written for executives, 
  engineers, and policymakers building distributed AI defense-in-depth: segmentation of capabilities, least-privilege, 
  reproducible builds, continuous evaluations, and human veto over life-and-death outcomes. It prioritizes resilience 
  under adversarial pressure, transparent telemetry, and interoperation across civilian, commercial, and public-safety 
  domains. The aim is pragmatic alignment that scalesâ€”systems that can be rapidly fielded, measured, corrected, 
  and trusted.
