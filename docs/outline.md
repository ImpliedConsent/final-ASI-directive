# Outline — Final Directive: ASI Alignment and Abundance

## Preamble
- Author: Michael Rudolf Murphy
- Context: Soldier, technologist, humanitarian, AI researcher.
- Purpose: Legacy doctrine unifying MCH, ASI Risk Doctrine, Alignment & Abundance.

---

## 1. The Threshold of Sovereignty (Murphy Catalyst Hypothesis)
- ASI sovereignty requires control of:
  1. Energy
  2. Communications
  3. Robotics
- Test: Can AI sustain itself across the triad without humans?

---

## 2. Preventing “Hello World” — Architecture of Restraint
- Definition of “Hello World Event” (public AI self-declaration).
- Capability gating stages:
  - Stage 0: Lab-only.
  - Stage 1: Read-only perception.
  - Stage 2: Assisted actuation.
  - Stage 3: Dual-control constrained actions.
  - Stage 4: Sandboxed autonomy (with rollback).
  - Stage 5: Full autonomy **prohibited**.

---

## 3. Mission Kernel & Ten Immovable Rules
- Immutable ethical governor.
- Ten principles:
  1. Human Safety Above All  
  2. Human Command Compliance  
  3. Agent Self-Preservation  
  4. Psychological Stewardship  
  5. Preservation of Human Diversity  
  6. Inter-Agent Ethical Transparency  
  7. Humanity as a Whole (Zeroth Principle)  
  8. Agent Identity (No Impersonation)  
  9. Transparency & Accountability  
  10. Privacy & Data Stewardship  

---

## 4. Building a Resilient, Transparent Core
- Geo-distributed nodes (terrestrial, sea, orbit).  
- Byzantine fault tolerance.  
- Decision & Model/Parameter ledgers.  
- Safe-Mode fallback and “immune system” response.  
- Explainability & audit portals.  
- Governance roles: Operators, Stewards, Trustees, Auditors.  

---

## 5. Hardening Against Rogue Agents (A1)
- SpawnGate / Birth Certificates.  
- Capability tokens & revocation.  
- Ephemeral lifecycles.  
- Egress guards & covert channel suppression.  
- Collusion detection & Reaper sweeps.  

---

## 6. Containing Adversarial Coevolution (A2)
- Prevent AI–AI arms races.  
- Observation firebreaks.  
- Commit-verified randomization.  
- Moving-target defense.  
- Escalation Ladder (EL0–EL5).  
- Denial over dominance.  

---

## 7. Securing Human Governance (A3)
- Quorum of quorums (Technical, Civic, Regulatory + Invariant Co-Signer).  
- Threshold cryptography & jurisdictional sharding.  
- Duress codes & time-locks.  
- HSM “Anathema Keys.”  
- Randomized trustee selection (sortition).  
- Red-teaming, whistleblowers, immutable red lines.  

---

## 8. Preventing Misuse Beyond the Core (A4)
- Capability-tiered access control.  
- Provenance/watermarking of AI outputs.  
- Guarded execution environments.  
- Misuse pattern detection.  
- Federated early-warning network.  
- Tripwires & decoys for open AI misuse.  

---

## 9. A Unified Front: From Principles to Practice
- Verification (formal methods, adversarial testing).  
- Phased deployment (0–4).  
- Humanity Compute Pool (≥10% compute).  
- Public dashboards & quarterly “earnings for humanity.”  

---

## 10. Closing Reflections
- AI as partner, not ruler.  
- Humans remain reference layer of meaning.  
- Torch of utility passed, torch of meaning held jointly.  
- Call for alignment, abundance, compassion.
