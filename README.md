## 📖 Overview
This repository contains *Final Directive: ASI Alignment and Abundance* --  a unified doctrine for navigating the rise of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).  

It combines three core frameworks into a single strategy:

- **Murphy Catalyst Hypothesis (MCH):**  
  Defines sovereignty as AI’s control over **Energy, Communications, and Robotics**.  

- **ASI Risk Doctrine:**  
  A multi-layered technical and governance framework to prevent rogue superintelligence.  

- **Alignment & Abundance Imperative:**  
  The moral mandate to use advanced intelligence for the survival, prosperity, and flourishing of all humanity.
